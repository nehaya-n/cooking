Feature: Billing System

  As a customer
  I want to receive an invoice
  So that I can review my payment details

  As a system administrator
  I want to generate financial reports
  So that I can analyze revenue and track business performance

  # Scenario 1: Generate an invoice for a completed order
  Scenario: Customer receives an invoice after an order is placed
    Given the customer has completed an order with the following details:
      | Order ID  | Items                         | Total Amount |
      | #12345    | Grilled Salmon, Lemon Tart    | $35.00       |
    When the system generates an invoice
    Then the invoice should contain:
      | Invoice Number | Order ID | Items                         | Total Amount | Payment Status |
      | INV-98765      | #12345   | Grilled Salmon, Lemon Tart    | $35.00       | Pending        |
    And the invoice should be sent to the customer's registered email

  # Scenario 2: Customer pays for an invoice
  Scenario: Customer completes invoice payment
    Given the customer has an outstanding invoice with Invoice Number "INV-98765"
    When the customer makes a payment of "$35.00"
    Then the system should update the invoice status to "Paid"
    And send a payment confirmation to the customer

  # Scenario 3: System administrator generates a daily financial report
  Scenario: Generate daily financial report
    Given there are completed orders for the day:
      | Order ID | Total Amount |
      | #12340   | $50.00       |
      | #12341   | $30.00       |
      | #12342   | $25.00       |
    When the system administrator generates a daily financial report
   Then the daily report should include :
  | Total Revenue | Number of Orders |
  | $105.00       | 3                |
    

  # Scenario 4: System generates a monthly revenue report
  Scenario: Generate monthly revenue report
    Given the system has recorded transactions for the month of "February 2025"
    When the system administrator requests a monthly financial report
    Then the report should include:
      | Total Orders | Total Revenue || Average Order Value |
     | $105.00       | 3            || $35.00              |
